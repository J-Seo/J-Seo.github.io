**Abstract**

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is a practical means of communication for people with language disabilities. In this study, we propose PicTalky, which is an AI-based AAC system that helps children with language developmental disabilities to improve their communication skills and language comprehension abilities. PicTalky can process both text and pictograms more accurately by connecting a series of neural-based NLP modules. Moreover, we perform quantitative and qualitative analyses on the essential features of PicTalky. It is expected that those suffering from language problems will be able to express their intentions or desires more easily and improve their quality of life by using this service. We have made the models freely available alongside a demonstration of the Web interface. Furthermore, we implemented robotics AAC for the first time by applying PicTalky to the NAO robot.
