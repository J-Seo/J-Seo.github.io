- **Abstract**
Critical error detection (CED) aims to identify the presence of catastrophic meaning distortion in machine translation. Fatal errors require significant attention because of their potential to cause personal or societal harm. The CED for Korean, an agglutinative language, is particularly highlighted, as minor variations in morphemes often bring substantial shifts in semantic interpretation. However, research on Korean is still underexplored and has room for improvement. In this study, we conduct the first investigation of CED for English–Korean to the best of our knowledge. We adopt prompt-based fine-tuning and propose various informative evidence to incorporate into the input prompt. Subsequently, we perform comprehensive verification and analysis to identify the most helpful guidance for detecting critical errors. The experimental results show that prompt-based fine-tuning with informative evidence outperforms standard fine-tuning by a large margin, demonstrating its remarkable effectiveness in English–Korean CED. 1
