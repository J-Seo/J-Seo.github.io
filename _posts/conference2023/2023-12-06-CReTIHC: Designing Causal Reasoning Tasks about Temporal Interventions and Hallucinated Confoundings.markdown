**Abstract**
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing. However, their ability to establish causal relationships, particularly in the context of temporal interventions and language hallucinations, remains challenging. This paper presents CReTIHC, a novel dataset designed to test and enhance the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs. The dataset is constructed using a unique approach that incorporates elements of verbal hallucinations and temporal interventions through the reengineering of existing causal inference datasets. This transformation creates complex scenarios that push LLMs to critically evaluate the information presented and identify cause-and-effect relationships. The CReTIHC dataset serves as a pioneering tool for improving LLMâ€™s causal inference capabilities, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of causal relationships in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The whole dataset is publicly accessible at:(https://github. com/ChangwooChun/CReTIHC)
