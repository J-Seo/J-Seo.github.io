**Abstract**

Critical error detection (CED) is a task that identifies an inherent risk of catastrophic meaning distortions in the
machine translation (MT) output. In this paper, we propose KNOTICED, a critical error detection dataset for
English-Korean MT. With the importance of reflecting cultural elements in detecting critical errors, KNOTICED
newly introduces the culture-aware “Politeness” type. Besides, we facilitate two tasks by additionally annotating
multiclass labels: critical error detection and critical error type classification (CETC). Empirical evaluations reveal that
our introduced data augmentation approach using a newly presented perturber significantly outperforms existing
baselines in both tasks. Further analysis highlights the significance of multiclass labeling by demonstrating its
superior effectiveness compared to binary labels. Our dataset and code are available at: (Due to the anonymity
issue, we plan to release our dataset and code publicly accessible upon acceptance).
