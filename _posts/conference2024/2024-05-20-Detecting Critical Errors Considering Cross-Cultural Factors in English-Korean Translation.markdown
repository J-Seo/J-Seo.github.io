**Abstract**
Recent machine translation (MT) systems have overcome language barriers for a wide range of users, yet they still
carry the risk of critical meaning deviation. Critical error detection (CED) is a task that identifies an inherent risk of
catastrophic meaning distortions in the machine translation output. With the importance of reflecting cultural elements
in detecting critical errors, we introduce the culture-aware “Politeness” type in detecting English-Korean critical
translation errors. Besides, we facilitate two tasks by providing multiclass labels: critical error detection and critical
error type classification (CETC). Empirical evaluations reveal that our introduced data augmentation approach using
a newly presented perturber significantly outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Further analysis highlights the
significance of multiclass labeling by demonstrating its superior effectiveness compared to binary labels.
