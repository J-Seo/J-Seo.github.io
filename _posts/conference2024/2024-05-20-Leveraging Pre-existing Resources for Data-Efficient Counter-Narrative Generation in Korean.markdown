**Abstract**

Counter-narrative generation, i.e., the generation of fact-based responses to hate speech with the aim of correcting
discriminatory beliefs, has been demonstrated to be an effective method to combat hate speech. However, its
effectiveness is limited by the resource-intensive nature of dataset construction processes and only focuses on
the primary language. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Korean Hate Speech Counter Punch (KHSCP), a
cost-effective counter-narrative generation method in the Korean language. To this end, we construct the first hate
speech counter-narrative dataset in Korean and pose two research questions. Under the questions, we propose an
effective augmentation method and investigate the reasonability of a large-scale language model to overcome data
scarcity in low-resource environments by utilizing existing resources. In this regard, we conduct several experiments
to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal that the performance can be improved by
applying pre-existing resources. Through deep analysis on these experiments, this work proposes the possibility of
overcoming the challenges of generating counter-narratives in low-resource environments.
