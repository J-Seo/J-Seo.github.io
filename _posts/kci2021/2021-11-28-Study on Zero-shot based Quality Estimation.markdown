**Abstract**

Recently, there has been a growing interest in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, which leverages cross-lingual language models (CLLMs) to perform downstream tasks that are not trained in a specific language. In this paper, we point out the limitations of the data-centric aspect of quality estimation (QE), and perform zero-shot cross-lingual transfer even in environments where it is difficult to construct QE data. Few studies have dealt with zero-shots in QE, and after fine-tuning the English-German QE dataset, we perform zero-shot transfer leveraging CLLMs. We conduct comparative analysis between various CLLMs. We also perform zero-shot transfer on language pairs with different sized resources and analyze results based on the linguistic characteristics of each language. Experimental results showed the highest performance in multilingual BART and multillingual BERT, and we induced QE to be performed even when QE learning for a specific language pair was not performed at all.
