**Abstract**

Recently, the use of speech-based interfaces is increasing as a means for human-computer interaction (HCI). Accordingly, interest in post-processors for correcting errors in speech recognition results is also increasing. However, a lot of human-labor is required for data construction. in order to manufacture a sequence to sequence (S2S) based speech recognition post-processor. To this end, to alleviate the limitations of the existing construction methodology, a new data construction method called Back TranScription (BTS) was proposed. BTS refers to a technology that combines TTS and STT technology to create a pseudo parallel corpus. This methodology eliminates the role of a phonetic transcriptor and can automatically generate vast amounts of training data, saving the cost. This paper verified through experiments that data should be constructed in consideration of text style and domain rather than constructing data without any criteria by extending the existing BTS research.
