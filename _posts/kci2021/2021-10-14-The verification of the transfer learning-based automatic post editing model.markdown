**Abstract**

Automatic post editing is a research field that aims to automatically correct errors in machine translation results. This research is mainly being focus on high resource language pairs, such as English-German. Recent APE studies are mainly adopting transfer learning based research, where pre-training language models, or translation models generated through self-supervised learning methodologies are utilized. While translation based APE model shows superior performance in recent researches, as such researches are conducted on the high resource languages, the same perspective cannot be directly applied to the low resource languages. In this work, we apply two transfer learning strategies to Korean-English APE studies and show that transfer learning with translation model can significantly improves APE performance.
