**Abstract**

Neural machine translation using deep neural network has emerged as a mainstream research, and an abundance of investment and studies on model structure and parallel language pair have been actively undertaken for the best performance. However, most recent neural machine translation studies pass along decoding strategy to future work, and have insufficient a variety of experiments and specific analysis on it for generating language to maximize quality in the decoding process. In machine translation, decoding strategies optimize navigation paths in the process of generating translation sentences and performance improvement is possible without model modifications or data expansion. This paper compares and analyzes the significant effects of the decoding strategy from classical greedy decoding to the latest Dynamic Beam Allocation (DBA) in neural machine translation using a sequence to sequence model.
