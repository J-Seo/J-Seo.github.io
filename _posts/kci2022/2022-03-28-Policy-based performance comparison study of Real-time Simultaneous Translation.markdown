**Abstract**

Simultaneous translation is online decoding to translates with only subsentence. The goal of simultaneous translation research is to improve translation performance against delay. For this reason, most studies find trade-off performance between delays. We studied the experiments of the fixed policy-based simultaneous translation in Korean. Our experiments suggest that Korean tokenization causes many fragments, resulting in delay compared to other languages. We suggest follow-up studies such as n-gram tokenization to solve the problems.
