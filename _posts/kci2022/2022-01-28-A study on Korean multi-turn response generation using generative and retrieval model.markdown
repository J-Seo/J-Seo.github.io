**Abstract**

Recent deep learning-based research shows excellent performance in most natural language processing (NLP) fields with pre-trained language models. In particular, the auto-encoder-based language model proves its excellent performance and usefulness in various fields of Korean language understanding. However, the decoder-based Korean generative model even suffers from generating simple sentences. Also, there is few detailed research and data for the field of conversation where generative models are most commonly utilized. Therefore, this paper constructs multi-turn dialogue data for a Korean generative model. In addition, we compare and analyze the performance by improving the dialogue ability of the generative model through transfer learning. In addition, we propose a method of supplementing the insufficient dialogue generation ability of the model by extracting recommended response candidates from external knowledge information through a retrival model.
