**Abstract**

Korean legal knowledge is subject to frequent temporal updates driven by societal needs and government policies. Even minor modifications to legal provisions can have significant consequences, yet continuously retraining large language models (LLMs) to incorporate such updates is resource-intensive and impractical. To address this, we propose KoLEG, an on-the-fly Korean Legal knowledge editing framework enhanced with continuous retrieval. KoLEG employs an Editing-Aware Learning Strategy and a LawEdit Retriever, which together adaptively integrate subtle linguistic nuances and continuous legislative amendments. To support this task, we construct the Korean Legislative Amendment Dataset, explicitly designed for continuous legal knowledge updates with attention to both temporal dynamics and linguistic subtleties. KoLEG outperforms existing locate-then-edit and retrieval-based editing methods, demonstrating superior effectiveness in legal knowledge editing while preserving linguistic capabilities. Furthermore, KoLEG maintains robust performance in sequential editing, improves performance on precedent application tasks, and is qualitatively validated by legal experts.
