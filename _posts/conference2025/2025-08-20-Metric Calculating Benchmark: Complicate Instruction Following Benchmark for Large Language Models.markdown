**Abstract**

Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective, deterministic and code-verifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution, including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs
